    "$$\\min (1,0)\\cdot (x_1,x_2)$$\n",

    "and $b = (2,1)$. This constrains $(x_1,x_2,x_3) = (2,x_2,x_3)$ with $x_2 + x_3 = 1$. On this constraint, the objective function is always equal to 3 and has solutions with $3 > m$ variables active (such as $(2,0.5,0.5)$).\n",

    "d) True. If $x_1^*$ and $x_2^*$ are two distinct optimal solutions then, $\\alpha x_1^* + (1-\\alpha)x_2^*$ is a solution, for any $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$. We can check this easily. Suppose that $c^T x_1^* = c^T x_2^* = K$, then $c^T (\\alpha x_1^* + (1-\\alpha)x_2^*) = \\alpha K + (1-\\alpha) K = K$, so the value attained is the same.
